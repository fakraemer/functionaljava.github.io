This is the code repository for the Functional Java website which is available at http://www.functionaljava.org/.

The Functional Java code repository is at https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava.

== Lifecycle

The process for changing or enhancing the site is:

* edit the source code in the `gradle` branch
* generate the website
* view the changes on a local server
* publish the generated pages to Github

The website uses Gradle 2.2.1 to build, generate and publish the site and depends on JBake 2.3.1  The project uses the Gradle wrapper, so it can be run if Gradle is not installed using the `./gradlew` command.  Useful gradle targets are:

* jbakeClean - Removes all generated files
* jbake - create the website locally
* jbakeServer - run the server to preview the website (accessible from http://localhost:8820)
* publish - commit the website to the master branch to make available publicly accessible on the website
