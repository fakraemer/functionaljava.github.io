== Building

FunctionalJava uses the Retro Lambda project to backport Java 8 lambdas to Java 7 bytecode.  This requires access to both JDK 7 and 8.  The build system requires the environment variables `JAVA7_HOME` and `JAVA8_HOME` to refer to the appropriate directories.

Building is done using Gradle.  In the root directory run:
----
./gradlew
----
This will download the Gradle build tool and necessary dependencies and build FunctionalJava.
