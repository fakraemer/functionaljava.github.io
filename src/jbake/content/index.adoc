Functional Java is an open source library facilitating functional programming in Java.  The library implements numerous basic and advanced programming abstractions that assist composition oriented development.  Functional Java also serves as a platform for learning functional programming concepts by introducing these concepts using a familiar language.

The library is intended for use in production applications and is thoroughly tested using the technique of automated specification-based testing with http://www.scalacheck.org[ScalaCheck].  Functional Java is compiled with Java 8 targeting Java 7 bytecode.  The use of lambdas within the project are backported with the https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda[Retro Lambda] library, supporting Java versions 5 to 8 and beyond.

=== Features

* Basic Data Structures
** Functions with arity 1 to 8 (`fj.F`).
** Functions with arity 0 to 8 that can produce exceptions (`fj.TryCatch`).
** Products with arity 1 to 8 (`fj.P`).
** Unit type (`fj.Unit`).
** Optional value - _type-safe null_ (`fj.data.Option`).
** Disjoint union data type - _compositional exception handling_ (`fj.data.Either`).
** Validation - _right biased_ compositional exception handling (`fj.data.Validation`).
* Immutable Collections
** Array wrapper (`fj.data.Array`).
** Immutable, in-memory singly linked list (`fj.data.List`).
** Immutable lazy singly linked list (`fj.data.Stream`).
** A package (`fj.data.fingertrees`) providing 2-3 finger trees for a functional representation of persistent sequences, supporting access to the ends in amortized O(1) time.
** Type-safe heterogeneous list (`fj.data.hlist`) for lists of elements of differing types without sacrificing type-safety.
** Immutable set implementation using a red/black tree (`fj.data.Set`).
** Immutable multi-way tree - aka rose tree (`fj.data.Tree`).
** Immutable tree-map using a red/black tree implementation (`fj.data.TreeMap`).
* Other
** Monoid (`fj.Monoid`).
** Semigroup (`fj.Semigroup`).
** Natural number data type (`fj.data.Natural`).
** Random number generator using a _linear congruential generator_ (`fj.LcgRng`).
** Reader, Writer and State monads (`fj.data.Reader`,`fj.data.Writer`, `fj.data.State`).
** Input/Output monad for abstracting IO (`fj.IO`).
** Monadic parser combinators for writing parsers by combining smaller parsers using composition.
** Conversion of data types to/from standard Java types.
** Conversion between FunctionalJava and Java 8 specific types.
** Configurable equality and hash-code for HashMap and HashSet.
** Zipper implementations for streams and trees.
** Automated specification-based testing framework (`fj.test`).
** Fully operational Actors for parallel computations (`fj.control.parallel`) and layered abstractions such as parallel-map, map-reduce, parallel-zip.

=== Example

Functional Java includes usage examples, here is one such example (import statements omitted) that maps a transformation across an array by adding 42 to each element.

[source,java,numbered]
----
final Array<Integer> a = array(1, 2, 3);
final Array<Integer> b = a.map(i -> i + 42);
arrayShow(intShow).println(b); // {43,44,45}
----
