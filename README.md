Functional Java Website
========================

This is the website for Functional Java based on the zip of the old website (http://functionaljava.org/).  The new website gets published to https://functionaljava.github.io/.

The prototype for this was publish to https://github.com/mperry/fj-web-fidbake with the site URL of https://mperry.github.io/fj-web-fidbake/.

The Functional Java project is hosted on Github, https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava.

The new website uses JBake 2.3.0 and Gradle 1.11.  The source code of the website is currently in the "gradle" branch.  Useful gradle targets on the "gradle" branch are:
* jbake - create the website locally
* clean - remove files create from jbake
* server - run the server to preview the website (accessible from http://localhost:8820)
* publish - commit the website to the master branch to make available publicly accessible on the website
